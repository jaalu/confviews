        <p>Hi, I am <a href="https://tanelp.github.io/">Tanel PÃ¤rnamaa</a>. You can contact me at tanel.parnamaa [at] gmail.com.</p>
        <p>Back in December 2021, I wanted to get a quick overview of top NeurIPS 2021 papers.
        I am a fan of <a href="https://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">arxiv-sanity</a>, especially the image thumbnail feature. It helps to get a quick overview of whether a paper includes nice graphs that summarize the work or convey the intuition of the proposed approach.
        So I created an arxiv-sanity-like <a href="https://tanelp.github.io/neurips2021/">view of all the 2334 papers</a>, and ordered them by rating. It included links to code, tldr sections, and additional meta-data available at OpenReview.</p>
        <p>This is now extended to other ML conferences available at OpenReview, i.e. ICLR.</p>
        <p>If you want to see such overviews for other conferences, let me know or create a pull request at <a href="https://github.com/tanelp/confviews">GitHub</a>.</p>
